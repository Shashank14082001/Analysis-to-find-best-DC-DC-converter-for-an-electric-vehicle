# Analysis-to-find-best-DC-DC-converter-for-an-electric-vehicle
This project describes the design and construction of the HV (High Voltage) to LV (Low Voltage) DC-DC converter for the Formula SAE Student Design Competition (FSAE) electric motor cars. The finished DC-DC converter successfully demonstrated a high frequency power transformer design, providing additional helpful framework to speed up the development of further DC-DC projects. Three different DC-DC converter topologies are shown in this paper: full-bridge step-up DC/DC converter, interleaved step-up DC/DC converter, and boost DC/DC converter. Interleaved 4-channel DC/DC converters are the optimum option for this application, according to simulation results. It is more efficient, requires less volume and weight, and has less electromagnetic interference (EMI).
